/* Some important points for margin

1. Margin is the gap outside the border and it's neighbouring element

2. -px works for margin

3. Margin collapse => suppose if there are two elements one below other and for the 
1st elem you give margin bottom 10px and for second element you give margin top 20px,
the gap between two elems wouldn't be 30px, instead it will take the max margin i.e 20px. 
Margin collapse is applicable only for elements one below the other, for elements side to side 
if you give margin right for 1st as 10px and margin left for 2nd as 20px the gap will be 30px  */
